# Database-management-made-simple-through-python
This book is for Oracle developers and database administrators (DBA) who uses SQL. The book is designed as a reference the material is intentionally present as concisely as possible. Since i assume that you are already somewhat familiar with python and relational concepts and basics of the sql language, I attempted to provide you with the information you need in a location and format that allows you to access it quickly, as required. If you are looking for clear , conceptual concise information about oracle implementation using python with the plenty of summary tables and quick reference to syntax and usage, then you have come to the right place. However ,if you are trying to learn SQL, and want a tutorial that will teach you about it from start to finish, you will probably want to start with an introductory text. I certainly don't want to deter you from buying and using this book, but i want to know that my approach is to cram as much concise and fast-moving material as possible into these pages.
